AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run Docker containers without managing any underlying EC2 instances. It simplifies container deployment by eliminating the need to provision, configure, or scale virtual machines. You only need to define your application's CPU and memory requirements, and Fargate handles the rest. This makes it ideal for developers and students working on labs or small-scale projects, as it reduces infrastructure complexity and operational overhead. Fargate also provides task-level security, automatic scaling, and per-second billing, which ensures cost-efficiency for lightweight or short-lived workloads. For networking, each task receives its own network interface, making it easy to assign public IPs and apply fine-grained security rules.
